# surfs_up

## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to analyse temperature trends in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round.

In this project, I will be analyzing temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu.

### Resources

**Data Sources:** hawaii.sqlite

**Code Files:** Surfsup_Challenge.ipynb

**Software:** Visual Studio Code 1.56.0, PostgreSQL 13, pgAdmin4 v 5.0, jupyter Notebook 6.3.0, Jupyter lab 3.0.14, Flask 1.1.2.

## Project Results

The below analysis shows the findings from the analysis;

### Summary Statistics for June

* The count of the data set is 1,700.

* The average temperature in the month of June is 74.9 degress fahrenheit.

* The maximum temperature in the month of June is 85 degress fahrenheit.

* The minimum temperature in the month of June is 64 degress fahrenheit.

* The median temperature in the month of June is 75 degress fahrenheit.

The screenshot from the result of the code is shown below;

### Summary Statistics for December 

* The count of the data set is 1,517.

* The average temperature in the month of December is 71.04 degress fahrenheit.

* The maximum temperature in the month of December is 83 degress fahrenheit.

* The minimum temperature in the month of December is 56 degress fahrenheit.

* The median temperature in the month of December is 83 degress fahrenheit.

## Project Summary

From the above results, we can deduce that the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

This is evident when we compare the maximum and minimum temperature for both months being the mid-point and year-end periods of the year.

Also the median temperature in the month of June is 75, while the median temperature in the month of December is 71. This tells the story that the temperature is most likely stable year-round.

In addition to the above analysis, we can also analyse the precipitation levels for the two months as shown below;

![Dec prec](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81701640/122141987-7d358e00-ce1c-11eb-9a88-b50d408229c1.PNG)

From the above screenshots, it shows that the chances of rain fall in both months are barely minimal.

This is indicative when we look at the median precipitation of 2% and 3% in the months of June and December respectively.
